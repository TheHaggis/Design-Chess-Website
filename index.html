                    <td><p>The queen's gambit is a d4 opening, followed by d5 and then white plays c4. The queen's gambit accepted is when dXc4 allowing white to play e4 taking the center. This allows white to have a bit of extra control and will eventually recapture the pawn with the bishope. Overall a very good opening for begginers.</p></td>

            <td><p>The London system is a solid opening system that is played with whiteâ€™s moves being d4, Nf3, Bf4, c3, and Nbd2. Black can respond in a number of ways but most of the time it will not interfere with your development. As such it is a very good system to use and can help you get a strong position from the start. It can get a bad reputation because you often play it the same way but that is just opinionated information and should not dissuade you from using this in your games.</p></td>

            <td><p>For starters the english opening is played c4 and often you'll get something such as e5 which is a reverse sicilian. However you may want to consider playing the english opening because it will cut back the majority of familiarity for your opponent. There are so many variations that it would be pointless to go into detail. But it would be helpful to know this and also how to counter it when playing as black.</p></td>

            <td><img src="https://www.ichess.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Anti-Fried-Liver-Attack-Starting-Position.png" class="imgfried"></td>
            <td><p>The fried liver starts with 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nf6. Then white will play Ng5 and black will play d5 in order to avoid being forked by the knight. The following move is 5. exd5 Nxd5 and the bishop is still being blocked but white will play Nxf7 anyways in order to force Kxf7. That is the only way to avoid losing major material. Then Qf3 checks the king, and here if Kg8 to escape the game is over. This is because after Bxd5 checking the king black must play Qxd5 to block followed by Qxd5, Be6, Qxe6 which is mate in 10. Even if the checkmate fails this gives you good development and you can launch attacks from there making this a good opening to add to your repertoire.</p></td>

            <tr>
            <td><p>The French defense is an opening with the black pieces and begins with e4, e6, and will usually go d4, d5. Now there are a few versions but this starts like this because it lets black get an easy anchor in the center right away. This will eventually lead to easier development and a strong defensive position. This is similar in many respects to the caro-kann only it is with the e pawn and not the c pawn. It tends to be a very solid opening for the Black pieces and would be a great addition to your repertoire.</p></td>
